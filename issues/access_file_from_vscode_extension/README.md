Greetings I am currently developing a vscode extension and I am trying to use a file in my vscode extension as part of a task. I first need the extension to be able to see the file in its own directory (in the out folder where the extension code is). Then use it in a vscode.ShellExecution to run a task does anyone know how to go about this google search and AI results are returning results as if  I am not developing a vscode extension
